# Tex File Generator

## What does it do?
It basically takes a CSV file of a group of students and creates a a copy of
the .tex file and it's corresponding PDF file. 

It will also create two folders: `tex-files\` and `pdf-files\` in whatever
directory you're running this script in where the .tex and PDF files will be stored.

**NOTE:** I've only tested this on Ubuntu so I don't know how it would work
on Windows. I think macOS should be fine too though?
